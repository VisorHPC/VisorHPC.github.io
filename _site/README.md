# VisorHPC: Workshop on Virtualization Solutions for High-Performance Computing

## About VisorHPC

Although virtualization solutions are quite common in server farms and cloud computing environments, their usage is in contrast by far not prevalent in the domain of high-performance computing (HPC). This is because, at least up to now, virtualization solutions like the employment of virtual machines (VM) have proven to be too heavyweight to be acceptable in scalable HPC systems. However, future exascale systems, equipped with a much higher degree of computing power but also with a much larger amount of computing cores than todayâ€™s HPC systems, will demand for resiliency and malleability features that may only be provided by increasing likewise the degree of virtualization within the systems. Moreover, recent advancements, e.g. concerning container-based virtualization or regarding hardware abstraction of high-performance interconnects, currently propel the idea of introducing more virtualization solutions even in the domain of HPC. Prominent examples for such added values stemming from virtualization and fostering resiliency, usability and malleability also in HPC systems are the possibility of live-migration and transparent checkpoint/restart, as well as the option to provide each user with an individual environment in terms of customized VM images.
